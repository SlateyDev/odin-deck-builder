# Deck Builder

This project is a personal challenge to make a deck builder.

Idea: (This will change as the game develops)
* You will fight a wave of monsters. This is to make it single player as I don't want to make a multiplayer game for this challenge.
* Monsters will have a health that will be reduced by the attacks against them using attack icons on your cards
* You will start with a deck of 10 cards? These cards will have combinations of.
  * Attack
  * Money
  * Defend
  * Heal
  * ???
* You will start with an amount of health
* Some cards will have a monetary amount on them. Using this monetary amount will allow you to buy from the market.
* Any money not used on selected cards is lost.
* Attack cards can only be used on a single monster, not split over multiple, unless the card states otherwise.
